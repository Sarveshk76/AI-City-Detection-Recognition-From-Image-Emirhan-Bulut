# **AI City Detection (Recognition) From Image By Emirhan Bulut**

I have released my City Recognition Artificial Intelligence Software all over the world as of now. Thanks to this software I have developed, you will be able to recognize the cities of Paris (France), Moscow (Russia) and Cairo (Egypt)! You just need to take a photo from your location!
The purpose of this software is to contribute to the smart cities project. My goal is to invent an artificial intelligence software that can recognize all cities in the world. Test data gets 98.83% accuracy, Validation data gets 97.73% and Training data gets 99.39% accuracy. The loss rate received is 0.0206. I offer this software as open source for the whole world.
